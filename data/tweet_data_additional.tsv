@InnerVoltRock or dead... long term Covid is real but what does 'feminizes people' even mean???		
You are the only smart one in the family. It won‚Äôt be that long before 1 or more have health issues because of the vaccine. Buy them this book for Xmas The Real Anthony Fauci. It about the vaccine and the corrupt pharmacist https://t.co/UK9J0Yoj3c		
@labronland @MadridXtra @marca It's defo not worth it since it's pandemic era and we've seen what Barcelona has gone through with mad wages structure in the club, which is why Messi was affloaded casue he made similar amount of money at the club.		
"So that's how I thought the pandemic's third year might impact academia, back in 2020.

Now I'll provide an update - but on the blog, and tomorrow."		
@Sportsnet Is there anything Covid hasn't ruined.  This amazing run is cut down by political nonsense.		
@waynewarrior411 @cfc_massi @TiffTruthSeeker @leijah19 @JoeBiden My mother from Covid and she had vaccinated and booster.		
@SikhForTruth @critica18495985 She reminds me of Bill Gates....zero medical education, yet daily regurgitates covid/vax like they are experts.		
"@AstroBeanX runaway for ye

too hard to pick a favorite drake song. personally, my fav drake is rapping drake so it‚Äôd be something like omerta, diplomatic immunity or do not disturb"		
@HeyJustAskin @AxJax @RBReich the reasoning, research, and data as to why vaccines are important in the fight against covid has been publicly available for months now. you simply won‚Äôt budge because you‚Äôre too prideful and selfish and can‚Äôt admit that your initial opinion was wrong. maybe one day.		
".@paulkrugman Reading your columns and reading ""Covid Malaise"" by David Leonhardt. It's like when a recession is declared to be over, and regular people protest that it is not over."		
The likes of Gates, WEF the co are going to be furious with the virus not playing ball. A virus with at worst severe cold like symptoms is no use whatsoever for terrorising people into compliance. What card will they play next I wonder?

@MaBovill @lisa_iannattone @stuperbug I am not a virologist, but Novavax (along w/ the other big-name vaccines) targets the spike protein. Since Omicron has so many spike protein mutations, it could be that it also will be vastly weakened, just like Pfizer/Moderna/AZ.		
@ChelseaHillier6 @randyhillier Is this for real? Who is he trying to fool? We‚Äôve lost our democracy during this pandemic and have unprecedented levels of authoritarianism.		
"@Draknek Ah cheers, I know the place near me is turning away under 40s.

Though getting a cheeky early walk-in is how I wound up getting AZ when I'm in the age group that should've got Pfizer üòÖ"		
@kfingleton Nah, pandemic can apply to regions: it doesn‚Äôt have to be worldwide. ‚ÄòEurasian pandemic‚Äô or ‚ÄòAmerican pandemic‚Äô would be entirely legitimate		
@drew_going @Haulingtmber @kaitlancollins @POTUS Far left is centrist in Ireland. There‚Äôs nothing far left about infrastructure, voting rights, and helping citizens through a pandemic that was enhanced by the government. There‚Äôs nothing far left in the plans.		
@YummyHouseUtube @Billius27 I just booked an appointment for my partner and I for Jan 9 at a local SDM. Used this site I saw on Reddit: https://t.co/L8pzLMok4Q		
"I implore anyone with young children: Do not force this vaccine on them. Nothing good will come of it.

Goodnight and God bless."		
You know, we could be done with this pandemic IF YOU WOULD JUST WEAR A FUCKING MASK AND GET VACCINATED you dumb mother fuckers.		
"@geoffwilton2 @hendopolis @SarahRosemary3 You realise kids are at tiny risk of dying from covid, right?

Were they ""killing the kids"" by keeping schools open during flu season?

Behave."		
@SBSNews The more you fail to report the vaccination status of the fatalities, the more conspiracy theorist‚Äôs gain in numbers, what are you hidingüòé

@ruperthewison @mdmak33 @Mary_Morris1 @pfizer I genuinely hope the booster does the trick but I'm not confident. This is just getting wierd imo.		
Been working here since July 2020 n i‚Äôm just now meeting most of my coworkers. Covid really crazy as hell		
"@Turn_MS_Blue Not sure, but I know he showed up at Bob Dole's funeral service as the ONLY unmasked person inside the entire cathedral. Why did they let him in?
He sat next to Amy Klobuchar breathing his unmasked putrid dragon breath on her. 
Her husband almost died from covid. Cruz can GFHS!üò†"		
"I'm very worried about the impact of #Omicron on Ontario's #LTC and retirement homes.

Ontario should seriously consider giving 4th doses to residents who are &gt;3 months from 3rd shots.

Staff should only be considered fully vaccinated with 3 doses, or 2nd dose within ~4-6 months."		
"Good to know: which monoclonal antibodies work against different variants?
We need updated policies asap. 
And updated mAbs and vaccines too, but the ones we have for now are still adequate (@Vir_Biotech's mAb and a third mRNA vaccine dose). https://t.co/KS3dGJ3c9I"		
@Cosmicpixle @IntelCrab Blinken is literally traveling all over the globe right now. The SECDef Was just in Asia. The Mossad chief is in DC. Every foreign ministry around the globe is business as usual. They‚Äôre all super vaxxed and well protected,		
Healthcare professionals are concerned COVID cases will continue to rise as people gather for the holiday season. https://t.co/yJFNR0bcjW		
Anti-vaccine mandate, against Women‚Äôs right to choose, and apposed to smart gun legislation is wildly hypocritical and ignorant.

I said what I said: 2 jabs of Pfizer. He still died because an UNVACCINATED daycare worker gave Delta to his 1yo granddaughter who he took care of (who also ended up in the ICU) &amp; the rest if their house, all vaxxed if eligible...you absolute ghoul taking glee in my family's pain https://t.co/rMIPjms0xX

@KevinMcCabe987 K Mac.. my dogg! Take care man..manage the symptoms (Tylenol) get a Pulse Oximeter and keep and eye on your O2 saturation. Do some deep breathing exercises to keep your lungs going‚Ä¶Other wise just rest and feel better. üôèüèæ feel betterüëäüèæ
