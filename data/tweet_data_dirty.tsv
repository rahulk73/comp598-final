@MaBovill @lisa_iannattone @stuperbug I am not a virologist, but Novavax (along w/ the other big-name vaccines) targets the spike protein. Since Omicron has so many spike protein mutations, it could be that it also will be vastly weakened, just like Pfizer/Moderna/AZ.	0	2
@ChelseaHillier6 @randyhillier Is this for real? Who is he trying to fool? We‚Äôve lost our democracy during this pandemic and have unprecedented levels of authoritarianism.	0	4
@Draknek Ah cheers, I know the place near me is turning away under 40s.  Though getting a cheeky early walk-in is how I wound up getting AZ when I'm in the age group that should've got Pfizer üòÖ	1	1
@kfingleton Nah, pandemic can apply to regions: it doesn‚Äôt have to be worldwide. ‚ÄòEurasian pandemic‚Äô or ‚ÄòAmerican pandemic‚Äô would be entirely legitimate	0	6
@drew_going @Haulingtmber @kaitlancollins @POTUS Far left is centrist in Ireland. There‚Äôs nothing far left about infrastructure, voting rights, and helping citizens through a pandemic that was enhanced by the government. There‚Äôs nothing far left in the plans.	0	4
I implore anyone with young children: Do not force this vaccine on them. Nothing good will come of it.  Goodnight and God bless.	-1	1

@Turn_MS_Blue Not sure, but I know he showed up at Bob Dole's funeral service as the ONLY unmasked person inside the entire cathedral. Why did they let him in? He sat next to Amy Klobuchar breathing his unmasked putrid dragon breath on her.  Her husband almost died from covid. Cruz can GFHS!üò†	0	4
I'm very worried about the impact of #Omicron on Ontario's #LTC and retirement homes.  Ontario should seriously consider giving 4th doses to residents who are &gt;3 months from 3rd shots.  Staff should only be considered fully vaccinated with 3 doses, or 2nd dose within ~4-6 months.	1	2
Good to know: which monoclonal antibodies work against different variants? We need updated policies asap.  And updated mAbs and vaccines too, but the ones we have for now are still adequate (@Vir_Biotech's mAb and a third mRNA vaccine dose). https://t.co/KS3dGJ3c9I	1	2

I said what I said: 2 jabs of Pfizer.
